## Steps Taken
1. Updated Python scripts from Python 2 to Python 3:
    - MRI\pythonscript\id_new.py > MRI\pythonscript\id_new_python_3.py
    - MRI\pythonscript ID4\id4.py > MRI\pythonscript ID4\id4_python_3.py

2. Refactoring Python scripts for future use and to be able to understand them better. 

3. Used Adobe Animate to look over:
    - MRI\ID-4.fla
    - MRI\ID-4.swf
    - MRI\ID.fla
    - MRI\ID-4.swf

Didn't understand the animation program, so moved on. 

## `TODO` List
- Install Scilab to be able to run the scripts from ./ParadigmFiles:
